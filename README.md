# Advanced-Object-Detection-Tracking-and-Clustering-Pipeline-Using-YOLO-and-DINOv2
This pipeline detects and tracks objects in video using YOLO and CSRT tracking, crops and enhances object images, extracts embeddings with DINOv2, clusters them using KMeans, and visualizes results via t-SNE. It logs processing details and saves analysis for each detected object
